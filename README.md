School-level competition video: 【第九届农装B类国二获奖作品：棉花变量播种机器人】https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jCyhB8EZ5?vd_source=f2363d1b121157b15409b799183edefd  
It uses an STM32F407 (VGT6) to receive information from sensors: gyroscope, 6 ultrasonic, 4 encoders, 2 phototubes, using these information to control four servo motor coupling devices.  
It also uses an STM32F103 (CET6) to receive information from sensors: 2 cameras and 2 phototubes, using these information to control three servo motors embedded with a homemade 3D-printed seeder that used to achieve the purpose of seeding.
