The 9th International College Student Intelligent Agricultural Equipment Innovation Competition - Category B: Cotton Variable Seeding Robot (赛题链接：https://uiaec.ujs.edu.cn/news_show.php?id=190). It uses an STM32F407 to receive information from sensors such as gyroscopes, ultrasonic sensors, encoders, and phototubes, and uses this information to control four servo motor coupling devices. It also uses an STM32F103 to receive information from sensors such as cameras and phototubes, and uses this information to control three servo motors embedded with a homemade 3D-printed seeder that used to achieve the purpose of seeding.
