# Cotton-Variable-Seeding-Robot
The 9th International College Student Intelligent Agricultural Equipment Innovation Competition - Category B: Cotton Variable Seeding Robot.  
You can find the competition requirements at the bottom of here: https://uiaec.ujs.edu.cn/news_show.php?id=190  
It uses an STM32F407 (VGT6) to receive information from sensors: gyroscope, 6 ultrasonic, 4 encoders, 2 phototubes, using these information to control four servo motor coupling devices.  
It also uses an STM32F103 (CET6) to receive information from sensors: 2 cameras and 2 phototubes, using these information to control three servo motors embedded with a homemade 3D-printed seeder that used to achieve the purpose of seeding.
